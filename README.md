# C64 Kernal source ported to ASM6502

The original source can be found at https://github.com/mist64/cbmsrc/tree/master/KERNAL_C64_03

The KERNAL ROM is 8k in size and located at E000-FFFF.

There are a few things to consider:
- The C64 KERNAL ROM seems to include some parts of the BASIC interpreter at E000-E4B7, probably because it does not fit into its own ROM.
- There are holes in the ROM with fill value $AA.
- The KERNAL code starts at E5000, but from E4D3-E4FF there are 45 bytes of code originating from the source _irqfile_ for fixing various bugs.
- Because ASM6502 does not .org in the output file some code minor re-arrangements have to be done.
